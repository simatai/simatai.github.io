[Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database, CARD](https://card.mcmaster.ca/home)  https://card.mcmaster.ca/home

Database of resistance genes, their products and associated phenotypes.

[Antibiotic Resistance Genes Database, ARGD](https://ardb.cbcb.umd.edu/) https://ardb.cbcb.umd.edu/

No longer maintained (last update 2009), all data can be found in CARD. Flat files are available for download.

[MOAD](http://bindingmoad.org/)

MOAD was the basis for the work by Durrant et al. mentioned in the review article 10.1111/cbdd.12423. Around 2011 they built ANNs called NNScore1 and NNScore2 to predict binding. Their approach has since been used in multiple further studies.

[PDBbind-CN](http://www.pdbbind.org.cn/)

PDBbind-CN is another database for protein binding mentioned in 10.1111/cbdd.12423.
