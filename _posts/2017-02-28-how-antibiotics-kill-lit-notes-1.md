# Notes on ''How antibiotics kill bacteria'' (2010)

The [review article by Kohanski et al (2010)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2896384/pdf/nihms210832.pdf) summarized earlier work by Kohanski on what is (as of 2016) called the ROS hypothesis:

> [...] researchers have developed methods to construct quantitative models of regulatory networks 
> 118–122, and have recently used these reconstructed network models to identify the sets of genes, 
> associated functional groups and biochemical pathways that act in concert to mediate bacterial 
> responses to antibiotics 8–10, 119

> The discovery of the common oxidative damage cellular death pathway has important
> implications for the development of more effective antibacterial therapies. Specifically, it
> indicates that all major classes of bactericidal drugs can be potentiated by inhibition of the
> DNA stress response network (i.e., the SOS response), which plays a key part in the remediation
> of hydroxyl radical-induced DNA damage. This may be accomplished through the
> development of small molecules (e.g., RecA inhibitors 125) or synthetic biology approaches
> (see Box 2).

The idea was taken up, but it's uncertain if it is true, see [10.1126/science.1232688](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1232688). There's 
''currently much debate on the issue'' of ROS, says [10.1016/j.tim.2016.12.008](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2016.12.008). 

The article gives an overview over the families and attack mechanisms of different antibiotics, and because I'm pretty new, [I made a 
mind map on it](https://coggle.it/diagram/WLXgrBiKogAB7V1r).
