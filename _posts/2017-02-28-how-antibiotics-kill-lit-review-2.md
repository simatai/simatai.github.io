From the [review article by Kohanski et al (2010)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2896384/pdf/nihms210832.pdf):

> [...] researchers have developed methods to construct quantitative models of regulatory networks 
> 118–122, and have recently used these reconstructed network models to identify the sets of genes, 
> associated functional groups and biochemical pathways that act in concert to mediate bacterial 
> responses to antibiotics 8–10, 119

> The discovery of the common oxidative damage cellular death pathway has important
> implications for the development of more effective antibacterial therapies. Specifically, it
> indicates that all major classes of bactericidal drugs can be potentiated by inhibition of the
> DNA stress response network (i.e., the SOS response), which plays a key part in the remediation
> of hydroxyl radical-induced DNA damage. This may be accomplished through the
> development of small molecules (e.g., RecA inhibitors 125) or synthetic biology approaches
> (see Box 2).

I wonder if anyone ever took this up. A quick check on Scholar did not bring immediate insight.
