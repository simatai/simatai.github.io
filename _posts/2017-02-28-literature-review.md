### Books

Jun Lin (ed.) et al. [*Mechanisms of antibiotic resistance*](http://www.frontiersin.org/books/Mechanisms_of_antibiotic_resistance/547) (2015)
The book is available for free from Frontiers.

### Introductory articles on the why, what and social mechanisms

### Machine learning and AI in drug and antibiotics discovery

Santerre et al. (2016): [Machine Learning for Antimicrobial Resistance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.01224.pdf) used genome data from the [PATRIC](https://www.patricbrc.org) database to train a random forest to predict if a given genome leads to a phenotype resistant to antibiotics. PATRIC contains annotated genomes, i.e. there are labels available like ''susceptible to antibiotics'' versus ''non-susceptibe''. They were able to generate a list of top gene regions potentially responsible for AMR (by PATRIC ID), identified
from feature importance calculated using RF (the paper shows example for tuberculosis MTB).
