title: "WHO publishes list of most threatening bacterial strains"

Ironically, only two days after this blog started, the WHO basically prioritized our workload with respect to the bacteria
of interest: [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2017/bacteria-antibiotics-needed/en/](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2017/bacteria-antibiotics-needed/en/).

We need to focus on 

+ Acinetobacter baumannii, carbapenem-resistant
+ Pseudomonas aeruginosa, carbapenem-resistant
+ Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-resistant, 3rd generation cephalosporin-resistant

and along the way learn as much as we can about

+ potential multi-target drugs (current antibiotics are mostly understood at a *singular point of attack* on a molecular level, the understanding 
  of network effects is less advanced, see [10.1038/nrmicro2333](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrmicro2333) for a review - careful, their ROS hypothesis is subject to heated debate)
+ the interaction with human cells both of the drug as well as the bacteria
