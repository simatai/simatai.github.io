## Antibiotic resistance is a problem
... which is why this blog will be dedicated to reporting work on **applications of Machine Learning and methods of Artificial Intelligence to the problem of antibiotics resistance**. There was a recent *[Call to Arms on arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.01224.pdf)*, and since I was looking for an interesting and important problem to spend some leisure on, I thought this is it. 

## Research agenda

+ *Understand the work that's out there already*.
  There is quite a bit of work already out there, which [I shall review here](https://simatai.github.io/2017/02/28/literature-review.html).
 
+ *Understand the basics of how antibiotics work*. 
  I'll write several summaries on attack vectors on bacterial infections. One of them obviouly being broad-band antibiotics, of which   plenty are already on the brink of uselessness. I'll try to understand how the biochemistry works and how Machine learning could possibly help to get from genetic information to predicting or constructing new antibiotics. That's quite ambitious, but hey.

+ *Summarize the available data*.
  Most of the work I've seen so far relied on existing databases of gene, protein and ligand/receptor characteristics etc. I put together a [list of publicly accessible databases](https://simatai.github.io/2017/02/27/existing-datasources.html) that we could use data from to feed into prediction & construction algorithms (- one obvious although probably slow construction algorithm would be genetic programming, others would be different heuristics search techniques from AI)
